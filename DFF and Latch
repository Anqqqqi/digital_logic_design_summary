### [**Describe the difference between a flip-flop and a latch**](https://nandland.com/part-2-the-interview/#26dc0b8b91615542c)

The main difference is that a Flip-Flop uses a clock as an input but a latch does not. The clock input on the flip-flop is used to pass the D input on the Flip-Flop to the Q output. 

A latch having no clock will latch or hold the output steady.

 In general, Flip-Flops are used commonly in FPGA designs and latches should be avoided used 

speed latch is faster than dff
